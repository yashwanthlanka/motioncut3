# Project Title: E-Commerce Product page
This project is an ecommerce Furniture website, specifically for a page with a header, trending products, featured products, a blog, newsletter signup, and a foot. The CSS styles are used to define the layout, appearance, and of various elements on the page. Here a brief description of some of the key components:
1) Variables: CSS variables are defined at the beginning of the stylesheet using the :root selector. These variables store common color values used throughout the stylesheet.
2) Utility classes: Utility classes are reusable classes that provide common styles for elements, such as text alignment, padding, and margins.
3) Header: The header section includes styles for the top and bottom sections of the header, as well as the header body, which contains the main header content.
4) Trending products: The trending products section includes styles for the trending grid, which contains individual product items. Each product item has a content section with a title, price, and star rating.
5) Featured products: The featured products section includes styles for individual product items, with a larger image and more detailed content.
6) Blog: The blog section includes styles for individual blog items, with an image, title, and excerpt.
7) Newsletter: The newsletter section includes styles for the newsletter signup form, as well as decorative circles in the background.
8) Footer: The footer section includes styles for the layout and content of the footer, including links, social media icons, and copyright information.
9) Media queries: Media queries are used to apply different styles based on the screen size and device being used to view the website. This allows for responsive design, where the layout and content adjust to fit the screen size.

Overall, the CSS stylesheet provides a well-designed and visually appealing layout for the webpage, with clear and concise styles for each section and element.
